# SCE

SCE is an outdated and incomplete program that aimed to play RuneScape
automatically. After shutting down my larger, more successful RuneScape
bot, I decided to write another one that would fix all of the problems from
the first. Well, we never finished it, but it had an amusing name and a
cool design (for the time) so I've migrated the old SVN repo and pushed it
here.
